# Election-Winner-Prediction
Election Winner Prediction using various Machine Learning Algorithms


Predict whether Indian Candidate for Election is a
Winner
Project Description
Election is an Public dataset.
In this dataset there are 19 total features and 2263 data-
points.
This dataset contains election data that stores state,
constituency, winner, Party , symbol ,Gender, Age etc…
On this basis we have to find the whether the candidate is a
winner or not.
Here target variable is “winner” column.
We have to apply all the algorithms to our model and check
which one gives maximum accuracy.
Perform the following using “election.csv”
1) Read the csv file and find df.shape, df.describe().
2) Preprocess the data:-
1] Check the null values from the dataset
2] Fill the null values using median or mode.
3] Remove the insignificant columns from the dataset if
necessary.
4] Convert the categorical columns to numerical columns.
5] Find the statistical information of the dataset.
3) Perform EDA on the dataset using visualization such as bar
plot, Box plot , count plot etc. .
4) Apply standard scaling to standardize the data if
necessary.
5) Split the data into training and testing.
6) Apply Logistic regression, Decision tree , Random forest,
KNN &amp; SVM to the same dataset and find :-
1] Accuracy of each model
2] Confusion matrix
3] Classification report
4] Deploy the model by giving same inputs to all the
models and check the accuracy and output of each model.
7) Observe the accuracy of each model and conclude which
model gives the maximum accuracy.
8) So finally the model which gives max accuracy will be the
best model.
